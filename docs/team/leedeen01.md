### Project: ClientNest

ClientNest is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a  Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, AB3 can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability track policy.
  * What it does: Introduced the ability to easily track policy changes, allowing users to monitor and manage policy modifications efficiently.
  * Justification: Financial advisors often work with many clients across multiple policies. Quick access to these policies enhances efficiency, reduces errors, and ensures advisors can confidently manage multiple clients and policies. It provides a centralized system for tracking policy changes, ensuring advisors can:
    * Maintain compliance with regulatory requirements.
    * Quick retrieval for historical policy data for client inquiries.
    * Improve decision-making by having a clear view of past and present policy changes.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link]()

* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.3`(1 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Improve parsing for `list` and `listpolicy` to prevent extraneous parameters (Pull requests [\#33](), [\#34]())

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the features `addpolicy`, `deletepolicy`, `editpolicy` and `findpolicy` [\#178]()
    * Added implementation details of the `addpolicy`, `deletepolicy`, `editpolicy` and `findpolicy` feature.

* **Community**:
  * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): [\#12](), [\#32](), [\#19](), [\#42]()
  * Contributed to forum discussions (examples: [1](), [2](), [3](), [4]())
  * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](), [2](), [3]())
  * Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates ([1](), [2]())

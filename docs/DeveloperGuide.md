## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/diagrams/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<img src="images/diagrams/UiClassDiagram.png" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<img src="images/diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/diagrams/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model)

<img src="images/diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The class diagrams below represent the internal structure of `AddressBook` and `PolicyBook` and their associated entities.
The `AddressBook` manages a `UniquePersonList`, where each `Person` aggregates multiple immutable fields (e.g., `Name`, `Email`, `Birthday`) and maintains associations to a `PremiumList` (containing zero or more `Premium` objects) and to zero or more `Tag` objects.

<img src="images/diagrams/ModelClassDiagram_AddressBook.png" width="400px">

The `PolicyBook` manages a `UniquePolicyList`, where each `Policy` consists of value objects such as `PolicyName`, `PolicyNumber`, `PolicyLink`, and `ProviderCompany`. This parallel structure ensures consistency across both person and policy management within the app.

<img src="images/diagrams/ModelClassDiagram_PolicyBook.png" width="400px">

</box>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage)

<img src="images/diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="800px">

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data, policy book data, user profile data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage`, `PolicyBookStorage`, `UserProileStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as any one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Task Manager

**API** : [`TaskManager.java`] (https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/tasklist)

<img src="images/diagrams/TaskManagerClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The `TaskManager` component,
* is a self-contained feature within the application.
* allows users to manage personal tasks like to-dos, deadlines, and events.
* is invoked via the UI, and operates independently of the main application logic.
* is launched via the `TaskManager` button along the top file panel.

The `TaskManager` feature consists of:

* A `TaskManager` class responsible for processing user commands.
* A set of command classes (`AddTask`, `DeleteTask`, `Mark`, etc.) to modfy the list of tasks.
* A storage class (`TaskStorage`) that handles task persistence via a local file.
* A set of task types (`ToDo`, `Deadline`, `Event`).

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<img src="images/diagrams/UndoRedoState0.png" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<img src="images/diagrams/UndoRedoState1.png" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<img src="images/diagrams/UndoRedoState2.png" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<img src="images/diagrams/UndoRedoState3.png" alt="UndoRedoState3" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<img src="images/diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<img src="images/diagrams/UndoRedoState4.png" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<img src="images/diagrams/UndoRedoState5.png" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Planned Enhancemnet**

### Policy-Based Premium Management

#### Problem Statement:

The system currently supports two separate operations: assigning premiums to individuals via the addpr command and creating policies using the addpolicy command. However, these functionalities operate in isolation—premiums and policies are managed as independent entities. This separation allows premiums to be assigned without validating the existence of a corresponding policy in the policybook. Such a design can result in premiums being linked to non-existent or invalid policies, potentially causing data inconsistencies and user confusion.

#### Solution:

To enforce consistency between premiums and policies, the following enhancements should be made to the addpr command:

1. Add policy_id as a Required Field in addpr
2. Validate Policy Existence Before Adding a Premium
3. Handle Outcomes with Clear User Feedback: 
    * If the specified policy_id does not exist:
        * Reject the command, do not add the premium
        * Provide a clear error message: "Policy ID POL123 not found. Please create the policy first using addpolicy."
    * Else the specified policy_id exists:
        * Proceed with adding the premium to the person under the given policy
        * Provide confirmation: "Premium with Policy ID POL123 has been added"

### Windows Compatibility Issues

#### Problem Statement:

We're encountering an issue where, upon fullscreening the application on Windows, certain UI elements (such as the command box) end up partially hidden behind the Windows taskbar. This seems to be specific to how fullscreen dimensions are handled on Windows systems. Unfortunately, our team currently doesn't have access to a Windows environment, so we're unable to reproduce and resolve the bug directly.

#### Solution:

Possible solution our team can do in the future:
1. Download windows virtual machine and use it to test our product

### Inflexible Inputs for Commands field

#### Problem Statement:

The Command input field currently enforces strict validation rules, including restrictions on special characters in certain fields. As a result, commands that include characters users might reasonably expect to use (e.g., punctuation in names or notes) are rejected. This leads to a poor user experience, as users may find the behavior unintuitive and frustrating—especially if they are not familiar with the exact syntax or limitations. 

Some examples but not limited are:
1. Names with special characters `Anne-Marie`
2. Policy Name with special characters `Health & Safety`
3. Policy Number with special characters `#102`

#### Solution:

* Relex the validation rules by updating regrex to handle more useful cases

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

Target User: Alex
* Alex is a young, fresh financial advisor (FA).
* He recently graduated and is eager to build a strong client base.
* He wants to grow his career by maintaining meaningful client relationships.
* He struggles with tracking numerous client interactions and follow-ups.
* He often forgets key touchpoints like birthdays and policy renewals.
* He needs a system that reminds him who to contact and when to engage with clients.
* Sometimes, he feels overwhelmed managing client relationships manually.
* He can type fast and prefers a CLI interface over mouse inputs

**Value proposition**: Young financial advisors often struggle with managing a high volume of client interactions, making it easy to miss key follow-ups and important milestones. Keeping track of numerous touchpoints manually can feel overwhelming, leading to missed opportunities and weaker client relationships. ClientNest helps young financial advisors stay organized, manage clients more effectively, build stronger relationships, enhance trust, and focus on growing their business.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2. The system should be able to handle up to 1000 clients and their records without noticeable degradation in response time during typical usage.
3. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4. The system should ensure that client data is accurate and consistent throughout its lifecycle. No data should be lost, corrupted, or incorrectly altered during normal operations or when interacting with the system.
5. The application should provide a clean, intuitive, and user-friendly interface. It should be easy for financial advisors with varying levels of technical expertise to navigate, with minimal learning required.
6. The system's search functionality should return relevant client and interaction data in less than 1 second, even when the database contains a significant amount of records (up to 1000 clients).
7. The system should process and respond to common actions, such as adding, updating, or viewing clients, within 2 seconds, ensuring smooth and efficient user interactions.
8. The system should be able to export client data in common, standard formats (e.g., CSV, Excel, JSON) to allow for easy transfer or analysis of data.
9. The application should ensure the confidentiality and integrity of client data, employing encryption for sensitive data both in transit and at rest
10. The system should be able to recover from unexpected failures, such as crashes or server downtime, and resume normal operation without data loss or corruption. The recovery process should complete within a reasonable time (e.g., within 5 minutes).
11. The system should remain functional and should not crash under conditions like incorrect user inputs, unexpected data formats, or server overload. It should handle errors gracefully and provide users with meaningful error messages without interrupting the overall user experience.
